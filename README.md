# Smart Contract Development Extension for VS Code

This Visual Studio Code extension enhances the development experience for Solidity smart contracts, making it easier and more efficient to write, test, and deploy contracts.

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting improves code readability and helps developers spot syntax errors and key elements in their code. This extension provides syntax highlighting for Solidity files (`.sol`), ensuring that keywords, types, functions, and other elements are color-coded and easy to distinguish.

### Code Snippets

Code snippets are predefined templates that help you write common code structures quickly and correctly. This extension includes snippets for frequently used Solidity constructs, such as functions and contracts. By typing a snippet prefix and pressing `Tab` or `Enter`, you can insert these templates into your code, saving time and reducing the risk of errors.

### Deploy Smart Contract

Deploying smart contracts can be a complex and error-prone process. This extension simplifies deployment by providing a command to deploy smart contracts directly to a local Ethereum blockchain (such as Ganache). This feature automates the deployment steps, allowing developers to focus on writing and testing their contracts rather than managing the deployment process.
